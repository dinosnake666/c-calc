This is a sub-optimal C calculator :

→ It doesn't check for under/overflow;

→ It only takes two operands;

→ It only uses additions and substractions in the code;

→ For the exponentiation, 0⁰ = 1;

[__Supported operators__]: addition [+]; subtraction [-]; multiplication [x]; exponentiation [p]; euclidian division [/] and modulo [%].

I will add more complex operators later.

Compile with : __make__

Delete .o files : __make clean__

Delete .o files and the executable : __make fclean__
